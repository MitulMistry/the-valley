# The Valley
An HTML5 text adventure system using [Phaser CE](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce).

![screenshot](readme_the_valley.jpg)

The Valley is a JavaScript based system for loading, playing, and managing non-linear text adventures. It allows for branching paths based on the player's choices and keeps track of progress and past decisions.

## Demo App
Sample application deployed on Heroku: https://the-valley.herokuapp.com/

## Features
- Non-linear branching paths: Progress along a variety of storylines that change and react.
- Player tracking: Keeps a record of choices made and makes data available to affect future decisions and open or close branching storylines.
- Load stories through JSON: Uses static JSON files to load the stories and player choices along with associated variables. Stories can be created in spreadsheets/CSV files, but must be manually converted to JSON before loading in application.

## Application Info
Project set up according to [phaser-es6-webpack](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack). Configured with [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Project Structure
### Initiation
The game initiates through [index.html](../master/src/index.html) and loads scripts through [main.js](../master/src/main.js). If deployed to a webhost, the game initiates through [server.js](../master/server.js).

### [States](../master/src/states)
The game runs through Phaser states that load and run different aspects of the project (menu, splash screen, etc.).

### [Mechanics](../master/src/mechanics)
The game uses systems to load text and manage the game state.

### Other
The game stores data in [globals](../master/src/globals), loads JSON files under [story modules](../master/src/storyModules), and keeps graphics under [assets](../master/assets).

## Commands
`npm run dev` - Use Webpack to build for development and run server.

`npm run deploy` - Use Webpack to build for production.

`npm run cordova` - Use Webpack to build for [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

`npm run test` - Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Install Instructions
Node Package Manager (NPM) is used for dependencies. To install the application locally, follow these instructions:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). NPM comes packaged with it.
2. Run `npm install` in the command line while in the project directory. It will install dependencies from the [package.json file](../master/package.json).
3. To build for development and run the local dev server at http://localhost:3000, run `npm run dev`.

For production, if deploying to Heroku, set the config variable `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` to `false` so it properly installs Webpack before building the application.
