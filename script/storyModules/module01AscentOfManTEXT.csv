AA000AA000AA,"You wake up in the cool morning air and are immediately overcome with expectation. You are a young boy soon to come of age and today you go on your first hunt with your father.\n\nYou are a runt compared to your older brother, who is being groomed to lead the tribe. You are treated poorly, but you persevere and now is your chance to prove yourself, that you to are a worthy man of the tribe."
AA000AA000AB,"You join the hunting party and your father looks at you skeptically, unsure of what to make of your character. Your brother hardly pays you notice and the other hunters follow into the forest.\n\nAfter many hours of searching, the dogs come across the tracks of a group of wild pigs. The hunters prepare their nets and spears and follow the tracks. You see the pigs in the thickets and the others stalk them quietly. Your father holds you back, however, and together you observe the hunters' tactics.\n\nOne of the pigs gets spooked and raises the alarm and the hunters chase the sprinting hogs. You make to follow, but turn abruptly at the nearby primal grunting. Before you stands a monstrous hulk of a boar with brutal tusks turned outward. The boars charges into your father and gores him and he struggles with the animal on the ground.\n\nWhat do you do?"
AA001AA000AA,"You throw yourself on the boar and struggle mightily, wrenching the animal off your father. It squeals in surprise and you knock it in the head with your stone hatchet. It's struggling stops as you crack its skull and you breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nYour father is amazed at your bravery and when the other hunters come back, they are in disbelief that you were capable of such valor. You go home to the tribe and when the others hear that you saved your father's life, you are considered a hero and for the first time in your life, your status in the tribe goes up."
AA001AB000AA,"You're given more responsibility and people in the tribe start treating you with more respect. As you, you find yourself enjoying almost as much status in the tribe as your brother. You are invited along on hunting parties and the others never forget your bravery.\n\nYour father looks at you with pride and your brother slowly treats you as an equal."
AA001AC000AA,"Your father and the tribal elders think you are mature enough now to embark on your rites of passage. Your brother has already married and it is time for you to take your rightful place as a man in the tribe, but first you must prove yourself. You must embark upon the Test of the Hunter and bring back the pelt of a dangerous animal."
AA001AD000AA,"Your father arms you with a bow and a stone hatchet and sends you off, wishing you the best. You take one of the hounds and begin your journey into the wilderness.\n\nWhich direction do you take?"
AA001AE000AA,
AA001AG000AA,
AA001AF000AA,
AA002AA000AA,"You distract the animal and it attacks you instead. Your brother kills it, but you are severely wounded.\n\nYou throw yourself on the boar and struggle mightily, wrenching the animal off your father. It squeals in surprise but kicks you in the stomach and you crash to the ground. You wrestle with the animals for what seems like hours, trying to keep it from killing you. It slips free and you scream in pain as it gores you in the leg with its tusk, tearing muscle and erupting in blood.\n\nJust as you think your life is at an end, the boar is skewered and lies lifeless on the ground, a spear protruding from its neck."
AA002AB000AA,"Your brother stands over you and lifts you up, having saved you just in time. You are brought home and are slowly nursed back to health, but the wound in your leg never fully heals, and you become permanently crippled. \n\nYou are seen as brave for protecting your father, but your brother is the one that gets credit for saving both of your lives. Because of your injury, you quickly become a liability to the tribe, and life for you going forward becomes filled with hardship. Things will never be the same for you ever again."
AA002AD000AA,"As you grow up you are constantly made fun of by the other young boys and girls for your limp. People seem to forget that you saved your father's life because you're unable to contribute. Their memories are short and in the difficult daily life in the tribe, the inconveniences you present take precedence.\n\nYour father favors your brother who is strong, handsome, brave, and fit to be future leader of the tribe, while you have been relegated to the role of village cripple. There is no fairness in the harsh demands of the wilderness and you feel there is little you can do to regain face."
AA002AE000AA,"Your brother has completed the rites of passage previously and is now getting married to the most beautiful girl in the tribe. Everyone is joyous that night, but you are left alone and forgotten. A daughter of one of the mason's, Dara, has always caught your eye and right now she sits alone beside the fire."
AA002AF000AA,
AA002AG000AA,
AA002AH000AA,
AA002AC000AA,"Your father and brother look upon you as you bleed out, your body battered and your bones broken. They feel guilt for treating you so poorly all these years and thinking of you as nothing more than a runt. As you lay dying, they beg for forgiveness."
AA002AC000AB,"You forgive them and tell them not to suffer for the past. Before you can say anything else, you slip away into darkness…"
AA002AC000AC,"""You never loved me..."" the bitter words leave your lips. Before you can say anything else, you slip away into darkness…"
AA003AA000AA,"You run for help as your father struggles against the boar. You find your brother and the hunters and frantically warn them, but by the time you come back, it's too late. Your father is dead.\n\nYour brother is stricken with grief and disappointed in you. You've proven yourself unreliable and cowardly and soon all of the tribe will know as well. Overwhelmed by tears for your father, you know that life in the tribe for you will never be the same."
AA003AB000AA,Your brother becomes leader of the tribe and blames you for your father's death. He and his newly wed wife shun you and so does the rest of the tribe. You were known as the runt before but now you become known as the coward as well.
AA003AC000AA,"You grow up in shame, becoming increasingly ostracized as the months go by. You do your best to keep to yourself and not bother anyone, but you always seem to be getting in the way. Your childhood friends grow distant from you and you are left to your own devices. Months pass and you get used to spending time by yourself because anyone seen interacting with you suffers damage to their standing in the tribe."
AA003AD000AA,"Your brother has led a hunting party south, but hasn't been heard from in days. The tribe is growing worried. Many of the tribe's strongest men were with the party and food stores are running low. To make matters worse, storm season is coming. The tribe elders bicker and cannot agree on what to do."

AA003AH000AA,
AA004AA000AA,"You run for help as your father struggles against the boar. You find your brother and the hunters and frantically warn them and arrive just barely in the nick of time. Your brother charges and skewers the boar before it can land a killing blow on your father. The boar squeals and gurgles and slowly goes limp, but the damage it has already done is severe.\n\nYour father lies clutching his wounds, groaning in pain. He has survived, but his injuries are grave."
