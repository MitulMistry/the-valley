I've found myself a real man, and I'll give you the fate you deserve.� She walks to you , drags you up to your feet, and stabs you in the gut with a knife, over and over again till your blood stains her hands completely red. Jeneth screams, but Syla grabs her by the throat and stabs her in the stomach as well, murdering her before your very eyes. Syla laughs and spits in your face and returns to One-Eye's side.\n\nAs you lie dying, bleeding out on the ground, you can't help but think one thing... Shouldn't have been so greedy."
